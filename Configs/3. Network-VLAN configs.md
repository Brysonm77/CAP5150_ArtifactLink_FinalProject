# Configs for the server and Win clients
## Ubuntu IP configs:
  * sudo nano /etc/netplan/lab.yaml
```
network: 
  version: 2
  renderer: networkd

ethernets:
 enp0s3:
  addresses: [10.10.10.1/24]
```
 * sudo netplan apply
   * applies changes to the network
 * ip -br a
   * used to verify changes were properly applied

Windows IP config:
 * Settings > Ethernet > IP assignment > Manual > IPv4 >
```
IP Address:
 10.10.10.50
Subnet Mask:
 255.255.255.0
Preferred DNS:
 1.1.1.1
```
 * All client VMs share the same subnet mask and preferred DNS. The only change is the final octet for the IP address. This can be anything the user prefers with the range of 10.10.10.1 - 10.10.10.254. For the purpose of the project, the server has 10.10.10.1 and the clients have 10.10.10.50, 10.10.10.60, 10.10.10.70, and 10.10.10.80.
