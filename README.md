# CAP5150_ArtifactLink_FinalProject
This repo is created with the intention of displaying  steps used throughout this final project (i.e., Network, WireGuard, OpenSSH, UFW, and any other miscellaneous commands). 
  * This is a supplementary explination to the comparative analysis between WireGuard and OpenSSH created, configured, and tested by Bryson Monteiro for CAP5150. 
  * Each section will be label with its corresponding contents to provide quick analysis.
## To ensure consistency the files under both folders are labeled to represent the flow of each section. Below is the ideal flow of the artifact linke: 
 * Configs
   * Utilized tools and software
   * VirtualBox configs
   * Network-VLAN configs
   * WireGuard and OpenSSH configs
 * Commands and Results
